                    Kabosu is a female Shiba Inu dog from Japan who became famous online as the face of "Doge," 
                    an internet meme that gained widespread popularity. The meme typically features photos of 
                    Kabosu with multicolored text in Comic Sans font surrounding her face. The text usually 
                    consists of short, broken English phrases that humorously represent her thoughts. Kabosu's 
                    charming expressions and the quirky style of the meme contributed significantly to its appeal, 
                    turning her into an iconic figure in internet culture. Kabosu was adopted by her owner, Atsuko 
                    Sato, a Japanese kindergarten teacher, who shared her photos on a personal blog, from where they 
                    eventually went viral and became the Doge meme.
