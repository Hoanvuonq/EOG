                    Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
                    It's the time that every Santa has a ball
                    Does he ride a red-nosed reindeer?
                    Does a-ton up on his sleigh
                    Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?

                    So here it is Merry Christmas
                    Everybody's having fun
                    Look to the future now
                    It's only just begun

                    Are you waiting for the family to arrive?
                    Are you sure you got the room to spare inside?
                    Does your granny always tell ya that the old songs are the best?
                    Then she's up and rock 'n' rollin' with the rest

                    So here it is Merry Christmas
                    Everybody's having fun
                    Look to the future now
                    It's only just begun

                    What will your Daddy do
                    When he sees your Mama kissin' Santa Claus?
                    Ah ah
