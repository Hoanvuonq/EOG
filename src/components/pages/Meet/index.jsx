                Tech billionaire Elon Musk has stated on Twitter that he is an alien. A Twitter user with an account called 
                'Tesla Owners of Silicon Valley' on Sunday asked the Tesla and SpaceX chief whether he is an alien.
                "Aliens exist in Physics and Philosophy," Musk answered. "Aliens could be among us...some people think I am an alien",
                but, its "not true," he added.
